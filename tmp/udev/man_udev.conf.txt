NAME
       udev.conf, udev.conf.d - Configuration for device event managing daemon

SYNOPSIS
           /etc/udev/udev.conf
           /run/udev/udev.conf
           /usr/local/lib/udev/udev.conf
           /usr/lib/udev/udev.conf
           /etc/udev/udev.conf.d/*.conf
           /run/udev/udev.conf.d/*.conf
           /usr/local/lib/udev/udev.conf.d/*.conf
           /usr/lib/udev/udev.conf.d/*.conf

DESCRIPTION
       These files contain configuration options for systemd-udevd(8). The syntax of these files is very simple: a list of
       assignments, one per line. All empty lines or lines beginning with "#" are ignored.

       The following options can be set:

       udev_log=
           The log level. Valid values are the numerical syslog priorities or their textual representations: err, info and
           debug.

               Note
               This option is also honored by udevadm(8).
           Added in version 216.

       children_max=
           An integer. The maximum number of events executed in parallel. When unspecified or 0 is specified, the maximum is
           determined based on the system resources.

           This is the same as the --children-max= option.

           Added in version 240.

       exec_delay=
           An integer. Delay the execution of each RUN{program} parameter by the given number of seconds. This option might
           be useful when debugging system crashes during coldplug caused by loading non-working kernel modules.

           This is the same as the --exec-delay= option.

           Added in version 240.

       event_timeout=
           An integer. The number of seconds to wait for events to finish. After this time, the event will be terminated.
           The default is 180 seconds.

           This is the same as the --event-timeout= option.

           Added in version 240.

       resolve_names=
           Specifies when systemd-udevd should resolve names of users and groups. When set to early (the default), names
           will be resolved when the rules are parsed. When set to late, names will be resolved for every event. When set to
           never, names will never be resolved and all devices will be owned by root.

           This is the same as the --resolve-names= option.

           Added in version 240.

       timeout_signal=
           Specifies a signal that systemd-udevd will send on worker timeouts. Note that both workers and spawned processes
           will be killed using this signal. Defaults to SIGKILL.

           Added in version 246.

       In addition, systemd-udevd can be configured by command line options and the kernel command line (see systemd-
       udevd(8)).
